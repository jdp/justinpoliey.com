### Hello

I'm Justin
and I work at [GetGlue](http://getglue.com),
a deeply personalized,
social and connected experience around television, movies and sports.
I live in the woods in northern New Jersey.

### About Me

By day I'm a software engineer focused on web application development,
and I'm just as comfortable on the frontend as I am on the backend.
Currently I'm helping build the backend services that power the new generation of GetGlue's web sites and mobile apps.
