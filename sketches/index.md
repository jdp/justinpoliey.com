## Sketches

I think that my [Gists][gists] in some ways are more interesting than my projects.
If full repositories are paintings,
and if you'll forgive the comparison,
then these are sketches.

### [Brainfuck to C Compiler][bf-to-c-compiler]

A [Brainfuck][brainfuck] to C compiler written in Python.
It's the accompanying code to an article about [source-to-source compilation][s2s-compiling] that I wrote.

### [Little Tail-recursive Concatenative Language][little-tailrec-lang]

A [concatenative language][cat-lang] is a language in which programs are structured through the composition of functions
instead of the application of functions to arguments.
I made a toy interpreter for one that supports tail calls,
whose syntax is inspired by [Factor][factor].
