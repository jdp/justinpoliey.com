I'm Justin
and I work at [GetGlue](http://getglue.com),
a deeply personalized,
social and connected experience around television, movies, and sports.

I appreciate thoughtful design and its complementary code.
When I'm not helping build out the architecture that powers the new generation of GetGlue's website and mobile apps,
I'm probably still hacking---[just on something else][github-jdp].
