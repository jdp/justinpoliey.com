## Hello

I'm Justin,
a developer based in NYC.
I work at [Streamable][streamable], where anyone can instantly clip and share videos.
I'm also a mentor-in-residence at [Techstars NYC][techstars-nyc] with a focus on engineering.

In the past,
I was in charge of backend at [i.TV][itv] on the [tvtag](tvtag) platform,
and before that I was director of backend engineering at [GetGlue][getglue].
